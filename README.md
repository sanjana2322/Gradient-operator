**EXP 4-a - Gradient Operator** = The gradient operator in image processing is used to detect edges by highlighting areas where the intensity of an image changes rapidly. The operator computes the rate of change in pixel intensity in both the horizontal and vertical directions. It is commonly used in edge detection tasks, such as detecting boundaries, shapes, and transitions between objects in an image. The gradient operator, denoted by âˆ‡ (nabla), is a mathematical operator used to calculate the gradient of a scalar-valued function. In essence, it measures the rate of change of the function in different directions.
**EXP 4-b - Robert operator** = The Roberts operator is a simple edge detection operator used in image processing. It is designed to compute the gradient of the image at each pixel, highlighting regions where there is a rapid intensity change, often indicating an edge. The Roberts operator uses a pair of 2x2 convolution kernels to calculate the gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions. The small kernel size (2x2) makes it more sensitive to noise compared to other operators like the Sobel operator, but it can be effective for detecting fine edges in an image.
